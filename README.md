# Description

Silent Shuffle conveniently mutes chat in Solo Shuffle matches, and avoid getting reported for chat abuse, even if nothing offensive was said or others just simply were frustrated by your amazing performance!

# Features

The addon currently works in Solo Shuffle and Arena matches, which you can enable/disable from the GUI in the Options->AddOns->Silent Shuffle tab.
    
It also remembers your original chat settings - for example if you had your chat disabled manually in the previous session or before reloading - and restores it after the match.

# Disclaimer

While the chat is muted, you won't be able to see any chat messages including guild and whisper. The only exception is messages sent via BattleTag/RealID, visible in Battle.net
